          <p>
            Welcome to Guess the Emoji, a multiplayer party game that brings people together through the universal language of emojis. Our journey began in 2023 when our founder, Ajey Nagarkatti, noticed how emojis had become an integral part of our daily communication.
          </p>
          <p>
            What started as a simple game played among friends during gatherings evolved into a full-fledged online platform that allows people from around the world to connect, compete, and have fun together. We believe that games have the power to bridge gaps, create memories, and foster connections.
