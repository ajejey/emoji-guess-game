      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-8 mt-6 sm:text-5xl sm:mb-10">Top Online Games to Play with Friends</h1>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">In an increasingly connected world, online games have transcended mere entertainment to become vital platforms for social connection, especially with friends. Whether separated by distance or just busy schedules, these virtual playgrounds offer a unique way to bond, collaborate, compete, and create lasting memories. The sheer variety of experiences available means there's something for every group, from cooperative farming adventures to intense intergalactic betrayals. This guide dives into some of the best online games to share with your friends, exploring what makes them tick and how to maximize your shared fun. As someone who's spent countless hours exploring these virtual worlds with friends, I can attest to the unique joy and bonding they bring.</p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-6 mt-10 sm:text-4xl sm:mb-8">What Makes an Online Game Great for Playing with Friends?</h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">Not all online games are created equal when it comes to group play. Certain characteristics elevate a game from a solo experience to a fantastic shared adventure:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-700">
        <li className="mb-2"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Ease of Connection:</strong> The best games make it simple to form a party, join a server, or invite friends into a session. Complicated setup processes can kill the mood before the game even begins.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Strong Communication Features:</strong> Whether it's robust in-game voice and text chat, or seamless integration with third-party tools like Discord or Zoom, clear communication is paramount. It's the bedrock of teamwork, strategy, and, of course, friendly banter.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Cooperative or Competitive Fun:</strong> Games that allow friends to work together towards a common goal or engage in thrilling, friendly rivalry tend to be the most engaging. The shared emotional highs and lows are what build camaraderie.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Replayability:</strong> Games that offer varied scenarios, customizable experiences, or evolving challenges keep friends coming back for more. If every session feels the same, boredom can set in quickly.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Shared Experiences & Memory Making:</strong> The most cherished games are those that generate stories – the epic win, the hilarious fail, the moment of perfect teamwork. These shared memories are the true trophies of online gaming with friends.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Accessibility:</strong> This encompasses multiple factors. The game should ideally be available on platforms most friends own (PC, console, mobile). The price point should also be considered; free-to-play or reasonably priced games are more inclusive. Good performance and understandable controls also contribute to accessibility.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-6 mt-10 sm:text-4xl sm:mb-8">Our Top Picks for Online Friend Group Gaming</h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">Here’s a curated list of games that consistently deliver fantastic experiences for groups of friends, blending original favorites with some new recommendations.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4 mt-8 sm:text-3xl sm:mb-6">1. Among Us</h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Overview:</strong> A game of teamwork, deception, and social deduction set on a spaceship (or other themed maps). Players are either Crewmates, working to complete tasks, or Impostors, aiming to sabotage the ship and eliminate Crewmates without getting caught.</p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Detailed Gameplay Mechanics:</strong> Crewmates move around the map performing short mini-games (tasks). Impostors have a fake task list and can sabotage systems (lights, oxygen, etc.) to create chaos and opportunities for kills. When a body is reported or an emergency meeting is called, players discuss and vote on who they suspect is an Impostor. The goal for Crewmates is to complete all tasks or vote out all Impostors; for Impostors, it's to achieve a kill count equal to the remaining Crewmates or sabotage a critical system until the countdown ends.</p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Why It's a Hit with Friends:</strong> The core loop of accusations, bluffing, and desperate pleas of innocence is pure social gold. Our game nights involving Among Us are always filled with the loudest accusations and laughter. It’s a game that relies heavily on communication (and miscommunication!). The thrill of successfully deceiving your closest friends or the satisfaction of outing an Impostor based on subtle tells is incredibly rewarding. It’s simple to learn, leading to quick rounds of laughter, suspicion, and sometimes, playful outrage.</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-700">
        <li className="mb-2"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Pros:</strong> Easy to learn, hilarious social dynamics, high replayability due to player behavior, cross-platform play.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Cons:</strong> Can be frustrating if players don't communicate or if a group has vastly different skill levels in deception/deduction. Relies heavily on the group's vibe.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Platforms & Price:</strong> PC, Mobile (iOS/Android), Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox. Very affordable, often free on mobile (with ads).</p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Tips for Playing with Your Crew:</strong> Establish ground rules for discussion (e.g., no talking during tasks unless a meeting is called). Encourage creative lying for Impostors and keen observation for Crewmates. Don't take accusations too personally – it's all part of the fun! Consider using proximity chat mods on PC for an extra layer of immersion.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4 mt-8 sm:text-3xl sm:mb-6">2. Skribbl.io</h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Overview:</strong> An online Pictionary-style game where players take turns drawing a chosen word while others race to guess it. Points are awarded for correct guesses and for how quickly others guess your drawing.</p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Detailed Gameplay Mechanics:</strong> When it's your turn to draw, you choose one of three words of varying difficulty. You then use simple drawing tools (colors, brush sizes, fill tool) to illustrate the word on a shared canvas. Other players type their guesses into a chatbox. The game automatically detects correct answers. The faster someone guesses, the more points they (and the drawer) get. The player with the most points at the end of a set number of rounds wins.</p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Why It's a Hit with Friends:</strong> Skribbl.io shines in its simplicity and the inherent comedy of trying to draw complex concepts with basic tools, often under time pressure. It’s a fantastic showcase for artistic talent (or lack thereof), leading to hilarious interpretations and wild guesses. It’s low-stakes, accessible to anyone with a web browser, and perfect for quick, casual fun.</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-700">
        <li className="mb-2"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Pros:</strong> Free, browser-based (no downloads), extremely easy to learn and play, supports custom words for personalized fun.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Cons:</strong> Drawing tools are very basic, can sometimes be laggy depending on connection, relies on players' sportsmanship not to cheat (e.g., writing words).</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Platforms & Price:</strong> Web browser. Free.</p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Tips for Playing with Your Crew:</strong> Create a private room and add custom words related to your friend group, inside jokes, or specific themes. Encourage verbal reactions and laughter over voice chat. Don’t worry about artistic perfection; sometimes the worst drawings generate the most fun.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4 mt-8 sm:text-3xl sm:mb-6">3. Jackbox Party Packs</h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Overview:</strong> A series of game collections (Party Packs) offering a diverse range of hilarious and engaging mini-games. Typically, one person owns the pack and streams it, while others join and play using their smartphones or web browsers as controllers.</p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Detailed Gameplay Mechanics:</strong> Each Party Pack contains 3-5 unique games. Examples include Quiplash (writing witty answers to prompts), Trivia Murder Party (a deadly trivia game), Fibbage (bluffing with fake facts), and Drawful (drawing absurd prompts). Players connect to a room code via jackbox.tv on their devices, which then become their input method for typing answers, drawing, or making choices.</p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Why It's a Hit with Friends:</strong> Jackbox games are designed for group laughter. They often involve creativity, wit, bluffing, and a touch of absurdity. The smartphone-as-controller system is genius, making it incredibly accessible. The variety within each pack, and across the entire series, means there's a game for almost every taste. It's perfect for groups that enjoy humor and don't take themselves too seriously.</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-700">
        <li className="mb-2"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Pros:</strong> Huge variety of game types, very accessible (only one person needs to own the game), encourages creativity and humor, great for larger groups.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Cons:</strong> Requires one person to purchase and stream the game, some games are better than others, can be less engaging if players aren't in a chatty/creative mood.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Platforms & Price:</strong> PC, Consoles (Switch, PlayStation, Xbox), Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, etc. Each Party Pack is a one-time purchase, prices vary.</p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Tips for Playing with Your Crew:</strong> Ensure the streamer has a stable internet connection. Use a voice chat service like Discord or Zoom so everyone can hear the game audio and each other's reactions. Enable audience mode if you have more players than a game supports, allowing them to participate by voting. Explore different packs to find your group's favorites.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4 mt-8 sm:text-3xl sm:mb-6">4. Stardew Valley (Multiplayer)</h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Overview:</strong> A charming farming simulation RPG where players can inherit a dilapidated farm and work to restore it to its former glory. The multiplayer update allows friends to share a farm, resources, and daily life in the idyllic Pelican Town.</p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Detailed Gameplay Mechanics:</strong> Players engage in farming (planting, watering, harvesting crops), raising animals, fishing, foraging, mining for resources, crafting items, and interacting with the local townsfolk (including marriage). In multiplayer, up to 4 players (or more with mods) can share a farm. Money and most resources can be shared or kept separate, depending on settings. Players collaborate on farm layout, daily chores, and larger goals like completing Community Center bundles or exploring the dangerous Skull Cavern.</p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Why It's a Hit with Friends:</strong> Stardew Valley offers a wonderfully relaxing and cooperative experience. Working together to build a thriving farm, dividing tasks (one fishes while another mines), and celebrating seasonal festivals together creates a strong sense of shared accomplishment and cozy camaraderie. I've personally found that collaborating on a farm design in Stardew Valley can be just as rewarding as any epic quest in other games. It’s a low-pressure environment perfect for catching up and unwinding with friends.</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-700">
        <li className="mb-2"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Pros:</strong> Deep and engaging gameplay, very relaxing and wholesome, promotes teamwork and long-term planning, rich world to explore.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Cons:</strong> Can be slow-paced for some, requires a significant time investment to see substantial progress, managing shared resources can sometimes lead to minor disagreements if not communicated.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Platforms & Price:</strong> PC, Mobile (iOS/Android), Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox. One-time purchase, very reasonably priced.</p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Tips for Playing with Your Crew:</strong> Decide early on how you want to share money and resources (options are available in settings). Communicate about daily goals and who is tackling which tasks. Consider specializing roles (e.g., one focuses on animals, another on crops). Most importantly, enjoy the journey and the changing seasons together.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4 mt-8 sm:text-3xl sm:mb-6">5. Codenames Online</h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Overview:</strong> The popular board game adapted into various unofficial and official online versions. Two teams, each led by a Spymaster, compete to identify all their secret agent cards on a shared grid before the other team does, while avoiding the assassin card.</p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Detailed Gameplay Mechanics:</strong> A grid of 25 word cards is laid out. Some words belong to the Red team, some to the Blue team, one is a neutral bystander, and one is the Assassin. Only the Spymasters know the identities of each card. Spymasters take turns giving a one-word clue followed by a number (e.g., "Animal 3"). This clue relates to three words on the grid that their team should guess. Teammates discuss and then touch the cards they think are correct. If they pick correctly, they can continue guessing up to the number given. If they pick a neutral card or the other team's card, their turn ends. If they pick the Assassin, their team instantly loses.</p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Why It's a Hit with Friends:</strong> Codenames is a brilliant game of word association, deduction, and careful communication. The pressure on the Spymaster to give clever, multi-card clues without misleading their team is immense. The ensuing discussions among teammates, trying to decipher the Spymaster's logic, are often hilarious and insightful. It’s a fantastic team-based brain teaser.</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-700">
        <li className="mb-2"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Pros:</strong> Highly engaging and thought-provoking, promotes team communication and strategy, relatively quick rounds, many free online versions available.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Cons:</strong> Can be mentally taxing for Spymasters, success heavily depends on the Spymaster's ability to give good clues and the team's ability to interpret them.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Platforms & Price:</strong> Mostly web browser based. Many versions are free (e.g., Codenames.game, Horsepaste.com), with an official paid version also available on some platforms.</p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Tips for Playing with Your Crew:</strong> Spymasters: Think carefully! Try to link words that won't also accidentally point to the other team's words or the assassin. Teammates: Discuss your reasoning before making a final choice. Consider all interpretations of the clue.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4 mt-8 sm:text-3xl sm:mb-6">6. Minecraft</h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Overview:</strong> A legendary sandbox game where players can build, explore, and survive in a blocky, procedurally generated 3D world. With virtually limitless possibilities, Minecraft offers diverse experiences from peaceful creative building to challenging survival adventures.</p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Detailed Gameplay Mechanics:</strong> Gameplay modes include Survival (gather resources, build shelter, manage hunger and health, fight monsters), Creative (unlimited resources, flight, focus on building), and Adventure (custom maps with specific rules). Players can mine for materials, craft tools and structures, farm, enchant items, brew potions, and explore vast landscapes including caves, oceans, and other dimensions like the Nether and The End.</p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Why It's a Hit with Friends:</strong> Minecraft is the ultimate collaborative canvas. Friends can join a shared world (server or Realm) to embark on epic building projects, explore dangerous dungeons together, set up communal farms, or even create their own mini-games. The sense of shared ownership and accomplishment in a world you've built together is incredibly powerful. The freedom it offers means groups can tailor the experience to their exact preferences.</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-700">
        <li className="mb-2"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Pros:</strong> Enormous creative freedom, caters to various playstyles (building, exploring, surviving), strong modding community for endless content, cross-platform play available.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Cons:</strong> Can be aimless without self-set goals, setting up and managing private servers can be technical for some (Realms offer an easier paid solution), survival mode can be challenging for new players.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Platforms & Price:</strong> PC (Java & Bedrock editions), Consoles, Mobile. One-time purchase, price varies by platform. Realms are an optional subscription for private servers.</p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Tips for Playing with Your Crew:</strong> Decide on a shared vision or project for your world. Establish community rules for building and resource gathering. Use voice chat for coordination during adventures. Share resources and help each other out, especially in survival mode. Explore player-made adventure maps or mini-games for structured fun.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4 mt-8 sm:text-3xl sm:mb-6">7. Fortnite / Apex Legends (Battle Royales)</h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Overview:</strong> Battle Royale games typically involve up to 100 players (solo, duos, or squads) dropping onto a large map, scavenging for weapons and resources, and fighting to be the last person or team standing as a shrinking "storm" or "ring" forces players into closer proximity.</p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Detailed Gameplay Mechanics:</strong> Players start with minimal gear and must quickly find weapons, armor, healing items, and utility items. Combat is fast-paced, requiring good aim, tactical positioning, and resource management. Fortnite features a unique building mechanic allowing players to create structures for defense or traversal. Apex Legends features hero characters (Legends) with unique abilities, emphasizing team composition and synergy.</p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Why It's a Hit with Friends:</strong> The thrill of coordinating with your squad, making strategic rotations, sharing loot, and clutching a victory against dozens of other teams is exhilarating. Communication and teamwork are crucial. Reviving downed teammates and sharing resources fosters a strong sense of camaraderie. Even when you don't win, the emergent stories and intense encounters make for memorable sessions.</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-700">
        <li className="mb-2"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Pros:</strong> High-adrenaline action, promotes strong teamwork and communication, free-to-play with cosmetic microtransactions, constantly updated with new content.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Cons:</strong> Can be very competitive and challenging for new players, fast pace might be stressful for some, battle pass/cosmetic focus can be distracting for some.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Platforms & Price:</strong> PC, Consoles, Mobile (Fortnite). Free-to-play.</p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Tips for Playing with Your Crew:</strong> Designate a "jumpmaster" to decide where to land. Stick together and communicate enemy locations and loot. Share resources like ammo and healing items. Practice callouts and learn the map. Most importantly, support each other, even in defeat – it’s a tough genre!</p>
      
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4 mt-8 sm:text-3xl sm:mb-6">8. Don't Starve Together</h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Overview:</strong> A cooperative, uncompromising wilderness survival game with a unique, gothic art style. Players must work together to explore a strange and dangerous world, gather resources, craft items, and fend off bizarre creatures to survive as long as possible.</p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Detailed Gameplay Mechanics:</strong> Players choose from a roster of quirky characters, each with unique abilities or perks. Core mechanics involve managing hunger, sanity, and health. Days are spent gathering food, wood, rocks, and gold, crafting tools and structures, and exploring the map. Night brings new dangers, requiring light sources to ward off unseen horrors. Seasons change, bringing new challenges like summer heat or winter cold.</p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Why It's a Hit with Friends:</strong> This game is <em className="italic text-gray-700">hard</em>, and that difficulty makes cooperation incredibly rewarding. Sharing the burdens of survival – one player cooks while another fortifies the base, another explores – is essential. The constant threat and eerie atmosphere create a strong bonding experience through shared struggle and triumph. Discovering the world's strange secrets and overcoming its challenges as a team is immensely satisfying.</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-700">
        <li className="mb-2"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Pros:</strong> Deep and challenging survival mechanics, unique art style and atmosphere, encourages strong cooperation and planning, high replayability with varied world generation and characters.</li>

Plan your days, assign roles, and share information about dangers or resource locations. Establish a central base and contribute to its upkeep. Protect new players and teach them the ropes. Don't be afraid to experiment, but also learn from your (many) deaths.</p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-6 mt-10 sm:text-4xl sm:mb-8">Choosing the Right Game for Your Group</h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">With so many options, picking the perfect game can be a mini-game in itself. Consider these factors:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-700">
        <li className="mb-2"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Your Group's Size:</strong> Among Us and Jackbox thrive with 4+ players. Stardew Valley is great for 2-4. Battle Royales are typically for duos or squads of 3-4.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Interests and Preferences:</strong> Does your group prefer intense competition (Battle Royales), creative problem-solving (Minecraft, Skribbl.io), strategic thinking (Codenames), or relaxed collaboration (Stardew Valley)? Match the game to the group's collective personality.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Tech-Savviness & Available Platforms:</strong> Ensure everyone has the necessary hardware and can comfortably run the game. Browser-based games like Skribbl.io or Codenames Online are very accessible.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><strong className="font-bold text-gray-800">Time Commitment:</strong> A few rounds of Among Us or Skribbl.io can be quick. A session of Don't Starve Together or building a Minecraft empire might require more dedicated time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-6 mt-10 sm:text-4xl sm:mb-8">Tips for a Successful Online Game Night with Friends</h2>
